The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior does not occur due to specificity and inheritance issues:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
  height: 300px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container .box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

.box {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* This style is unexpectedly overridden */
}
```

In this case, we might expect the `.box` element to have a background color of `lightgreen` because of the later style definition. However, due to the specificity of `.container .box`, the `lightcoral` color is applied instead. This is a common issue stemming from a lack of understanding of CSS specificity.
